This is a fork of the website of [SD Ruby](http://sdruby.org), a local Ruby user group based in San Diego, CA.

Plan to add a forum, extend the member profile, utilize the job board, and introduce localization.

Note that a few features are being removed from the original code base, i.e. this is not exactly a superset of the sdruby code base. 

Thanks to the original (SD Ruby) Contributors:

* Neal Clark
* Patrick Crowley
* Jordan Fowler
* Rob Kaufman
* Nick Zadrozny
